			<h2>Epigraph</h2>
			<p><i>“But Peter and the apostles answered and said, ‘We must obey God rather than men.” ’.</i><br/> (Acts V, 29⁠–⁠30)</p>
			<p><i>“Such problems [our war-torn world] are never solved by legislation or tricks. They are only solved by a general change in attitude. And the change does not begin with propaganda and mass meetings and violence. It begins with a change in individuals. The accumulation of such changes will produce a collective solution.”<br/></i> Carl Jung.</p>
			<p>“You see the beauty of my proposal is it needn’t wait on general revolution. I bid you to the one man revolution⁠—The only revolution that is coming.”<br/>Robert Frost in <i>Build Soil</i>,<br/> A Political Pastoral.</p>
