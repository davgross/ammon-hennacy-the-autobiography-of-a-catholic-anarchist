                        “I pay no attention to rules of grammar but go by the sound and feeling of what I write.” ―Ammon Hennacy

                        <p>
                         The 1954 Catholic Worker Books edition of this book, which served as the source for this version, suffers from slapdash editing of Hennacy’s original material as it appeared in various sources that themselves were composed with a variety of styles and standards. I have made what I believe to be improvements to the original text for this edition. For example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                         <li>I corrected typos and misprints when I found them.</li>
                         <li>I modernized spelling.</li>
                         <li>I used italics instead of all-caps to denote titles of publications, and made other typographical improvements of this sort.</li>
                         <li>I improved and standardized the punctuation, in particular ameliorating somewhat Hennacy’s over-reliance on the semi-colon.</li>
                         <li>I back-ported some editorial improvements that were made in a later edition of Hennacy’s autobiography—<i epub:type="se:name:publication:book">The Book of Ammon</i> (first published in 1965; I consulted the 1970 fifth printing)–which incorporates some of what was in this earlier autobiography.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
